# Microprocessor-Systems-Lab-Answers
Code for AVR ATMEGA328PB for the Lab of Microprocessor Systems of the 6th Semester in NTUA

 -Lab 1:
 
   -Exercise 1: Assembly Code for atmega328pb that implements the logical functions
     F0 = (A*B'+BD)
     F1=(A'+C')*(B'+D)
    
-Exercise 2:
 Check the movement of a trail, from LSB to MSB, with appropriate time delays in assemmbly

 -Lab 2:  (Interrupts)
 
  -Exercise 1:Assembly code that counts the number of INT1 interrupts with the leds PC0-PC3 (interrupts are 0-15). When the PD7 pressed, the counting of       interrupts is frozen.
    
   -Exercise 2: C code that when INT1 interrupt happens, we turn PB0 led on for 3 seconds. In case of an interrupt duringn the 3 seconds, all PORTB leds turn on for 1 second, while PB0 remains open for a total of 3 seconds.
